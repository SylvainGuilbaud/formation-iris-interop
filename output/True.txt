2023-04-20 22:50:35 : Can someone please tell me what a s!ssy means? : abgcd22 : https://www.reddit.com/r/feminineboys/comments/12thyza/can_someone_please_tell_me_what_a_sssy_means/

Hi everyone English is not my first language so can someone tell me what exactly does this word mean?

My understanding is that it is a male that is behaving like a female so in some way same as a femboy. 

I know a lot of people don't like it because it is degrading to them but I don't know why exactly is it degrading. People have called me that and I haven't been finding it offensive (mostly because I don't think I know the true meaning of this word). May be I am one? Or may be I am not one and I should tell people to stop calling me that.

I personally think sunburn won today with some seriously potent jams and with the 40% off I made enough to get $250 off with my points next time I go in. And the in-store experience went super smooth and quick . I was going to try to pick up my true leave order today but I don't feel like dealing with that so I'm happy with sunburn

2023-04-20 22:50:58 : I’m having physical chest pains over loss of cat. : frankieT2020 : https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/12thzcl/im_having_physical_chest_pains_over_loss_of_cat/

I genuinely don’t know how I’ll ever be the same. Our kitty was to turn 18 this summer. She was orange and had beautiful long hair and a gorgeous white chest. My mom fosters and rescues cats and that’s how we got her. 

When her and her sister were getting spayed, her sister had a seizure and ended up going blind. We ended up keeping her sister because we knew she would need a lot of care. We ended up keeping my cat who just passed as a “plus one” however she ended up becoming THE one. 

I must admit, I have never been the biggest cat fan. I was always keen on dogs however that changed in the last 5 years or so. I am now the biggest cat fan and can’t imagine how I’ll go through life without her. My cat really helped me through the pandemic. She was with me through some really tough times and helped me discover who I am. We have become so close where we’d do all my favorite things together. I don’t look forward to anything more than coming home after a long day, putting my favorite series on and snuggling her all night. She would lay on my chest and purrrr for hours on end. She was just a true character and played such a pivotal role in my life. I can’t do any of my favorite things because I would do them all with her. Many of these things I discovered in the last few years when she was by my side. We even took her on family vacations.

The last few days she grew to be lethargic and we immediately knew she wasn’t herself. After bringing her to the vets and a long night at the emergency clinic, she was diagnosed with lymphoma. This was totally unexpected. I was praying for an infection because she was sneezy and water in the eyes figuring she’d be good as new after a round of antibiotics. Low and behold we had to help her pass on today. She was not herself and it was evident she was struggling. The vet said this was this best thing to do and we agree however that does not make it any easier. I have been bawling my eyes out and I have physical chest pains and weakness. I am also experiencing this spiraling of anxiety and it’s torture. What on earth do you do? I’ve never experienced this. God bless everyone who’s ever felt this before…

Would an ‘06 Highlander 3.3L V6 for $6500 with 120K miles on it be too good to be true in todays market through Craigslist? Any red flags for this car? Easy to turn back odometer? Anything to look out for?
