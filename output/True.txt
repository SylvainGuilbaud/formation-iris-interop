2023-04-20 22:50:35 : Can someone please tell me what a s!ssy means? : abgcd22 : https://www.reddit.com/r/feminineboys/comments/12thyza/can_someone_please_tell_me_what_a_sssy_means/

Hi everyone English is not my first language so can someone tell me what exactly does this word mean?

My understanding is that it is a male that is behaving like a female so in some way same as a femboy. 

I know a lot of people don't like it because it is degrading to them but I don't know why exactly is it degrading. People have called me that and I haven't been finding it offensive (mostly because I don't think I know the true meaning of this word). May be I am one? Or may be I am not one and I should tell people to stop calling me that.

I personally think sunburn won today with some seriously potent jams and with the 40% off I made enough to get $250 off with my points next time I go in. And the in-store experience went super smooth and quick . I was going to try to pick up my true leave order today but I don't feel like dealing with that so I'm happy with sunburn

2023-04-20 22:50:58 : I’m having physical chest pains over loss of cat. : frankieT2020 : https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/12thzcl/im_having_physical_chest_pains_over_loss_of_cat/

I genuinely don’t know how I’ll ever be the same. Our kitty was to turn 18 this summer. She was orange and had beautiful long hair and a gorgeous white chest. My mom fosters and rescues cats and that’s how we got her. 

When her and her sister were getting spayed, her sister had a seizure and ended up going blind. We ended up keeping her sister because we knew she would need a lot of care. We ended up keeping my cat who just passed as a “plus one” however she ended up becoming THE one. 

I must admit, I have never been the biggest cat fan. I was always keen on dogs however that changed in the last 5 years or so. I am now the biggest cat fan and can’t imagine how I’ll go through life without her. My cat really helped me through the pandemic. She was with me through some really tough times and helped me discover who I am. We have become so close where we’d do all my favorite things together. I don’t look forward to anything more than coming home after a long day, putting my favorite series on and snuggling her all night. She would lay on my chest and purrrr for hours on end. She was just a true character and played such a pivotal role in my life. I can’t do any of my favorite things because I would do them all with her. Many of these things I discovered in the last few years when she was by my side. We even took her on family vacations.

The last few days she grew to be lethargic and we immediately knew she wasn’t herself. After bringing her to the vets and a long night at the emergency clinic, she was diagnosed with lymphoma. This was totally unexpected. I was praying for an infection because she was sneezy and water in the eyes figuring she’d be good as new after a round of antibiotics. Low and behold we had to help her pass on today. She was not herself and it was evident she was struggling. The vet said this was this best thing to do and we agree however that does not make it any easier. I have been bawling my eyes out and I have physical chest pains and weakness. I am also experiencing this spiraling of anxiety and it’s torture. What on earth do you do? I’ve never experienced this. God bless everyone who’s ever felt this before…

2023-04-21 10:48:27 : Pleasure Network, 3.6M MC, Currently Trending on CMC, 3 Working Products, Major Global Marketing &amp; Surprise News Incoming : No-Ad8381 : https://www.reddit.com/r/SatoshiBets/comments/12txrtz/pleasure_network_36m_mc_currently_trending_on_cmc/

**ALL LINKS:** [https://linktr.ee/Pleasure\_Network](https://linktr.ee/Pleasure_Network)

**The Problem**

Despite being responsible for the mass adoption of many new technologies, the adult entertainment industry has often been unfairly criticized by traditional monetization and platform providers on the internet. Adult creators are still reliant on traditional payment processors that charge high fees, incur chargebacks, and may result in account closures. Pleasure Coin aims to solve this problem by utilizing a decentralized platform that offers true individual content creator control of their content and payment.

**The Solution: Pleasure Coin ($NSFW)**

Pleasure Coin is a utility token that is usable within an ecosystem of adult content creator-focused applications. By utilizing the power of our native token, Pleasure Network ensures that content creators are compensated for their content. The platform utilizes blockchain technology to support content creators by creating a clear record of definitive transactions, which prevents fake refunds or claims. This also provides users with a level of anonymity and freedom in supporting their favourite creators, creating a safe and secure ecosystem. With the native token powering all of Pleasure Network’s current and future adult platforms, we are building a fully self-sustaining adult ecosystem, while offering content creators better or greater control over their content and users more anonymity as well as security in supporting their favourite creators.

Pleasure Network is an ecosystem, meaning there are several sub-projects under it, each interlinked effectively for the well-being of the community and to deliver a finer experience, with the native token as the fuel of the economy:

**The Platforms**

Pleasure Network has three platforms - Pleasurely, PleasureNifty, and Pleasureland - that cater to different needs of adult entertainment enthusiasts and all run on Pleasure Coin:

***Pleasurely*** \- Is Pleasure Network's social platform that brings the finest features from existing platforms to drive utility to the central token.

The platform offers free, pay-per-view (PPV), and subscription 18+ content, DM’s, and Tipping, amongst other upcoming features making Pleasurely a major competitor in the adult content market.

***PleasureNifty*** \- Is an adult NFT marketplace powered by Pleasure Coin. The platform enables creators to sell unique, one-of-a-kind pieces of content to their fans, while ensuring that creators are compensated fairly through royalties on all sales. PleasureNift also supports several networks, allowing creators to mint NFTs on any of these, with rarity tools to help them create one-of-a-kind NFTs, amongst more cutting-edge marketplace features on the wa

***Pleasureland*** \- Is our metaverse, created for an interactive adult experience, bringing web 3.0 to virtual worlds. Though in the early stages, Pleasureland has managed to attract metaverse enthusiasts and users in huge numbers, and current/further developments can be seen on the Pleasure Coin site Roadmap.

**Tokenomics**

Pleasure Coin has a total supply of 69,000,000,000 tokens, with a circulating supply of 44,572,559,899 tokens. Staking is available, and there are no taxes.

Long story short I am a food runner and make 30$ an hour. I am extremely grateful for that but my mental health is done for. I work 4-10:30 (opposite of my husband so I only see him on the weekends) my coworker team is full of guys that are miserable as hell and complain nonstop and it makes it so difficult to be around. They dislike me strongly because I speak my mind and call them out on their bs. My leadership team is basically kids that don’t bother us nor care. My job pays for my college so I will stay but I am debating transferring to another location. (i work at D-World) so I would go to 18$ an hour and there’s plenty of other jobs I can do and work mornings instead. It’s a big money loss but I won’t be running food nonstop for hours on end which is exhausting. We do not get a break either. We have a high turn over rate. Mentally I am broken going there. When I say everyone is miserable, it is true and it’s rubbing off way too much. I will add that our restaurant kitchen is extremely hot, everyone’s faces are always beat red. Kitchen was made in 70s and there is no air flow.  (It makes it difficult even more to be there) we had a fan which our chef got rid of. 
I’m going to school to be in the medical field. 
What should I do?!

Hi all, we're currently booking out our various tickets for things we want to do and the Universal Studios express tickets all seem to be sold out already for the dates that we're in Osaka (22 &amp; 23 May). Is this really true or likely to be a website issue? When we first started booking our holiday, tickets for the park were not available at all and we had to wait until closer to our trip to book them, but now I'm worried we've left our booking for too long and won't be able to get Express Pass tickets. Grateful for any adivce anyone might have regarding these tickets!

Some reputable private MBA colleges in Greater Noida with low fees allow MBA aspirants to enroll without taking an admission exam. Direct admission is possible for admission to many **MBA colleges without entrance exam**. Although it is true that the majority of MBA colleges in Delhi offer admission through tests like the CAT, XAT, MAT, SNAP, and many more. However, several reputable private MBA colleges in Greater Noida with fee structure less than Public Universities in Delhi also provide direct MBA admission. If the institute fails to hold its entrance exam, the affiliated MBA colleges in Delhi were advised by the AICTE to accept direct admission on the basis of applicants' academic records.

2023-04-21 10:53:36 : Is it me or him? Am I the abuser? : ThrowRASugarMomos : https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXIndia/comments/12txw3w/is_it_me_or_him_am_i_the_abuser/

Why does he say I guilt tripped him to stay in the relationship where all I said was he can’t leave when he has to take responsibility for the abortion? Did he not want a relationship? Did he expect me to act like I’m in a relationship with him? He said he asked for being in a relationship and asked me to give him a second chance because he felt guilt tripped because I wasn’t talking to him? In reality I was talking to him, he says he didn’t want to see me hurt and not talking to him and ignore him most times so he would ask to be in a relationship and lie about it? Am I a fool? He played with my feelings quite a bit. I also yelled at him multiple times during the Abortion for not doing anything without prompting and just playing video games. He kept coming back and chasing me until I said no and started treating me like shit the moment I said yes.  He drives me crazy and makes me so angry. He keeps lying to my face that he doesn’t remember it and when I he tell him the exact thing that happened he remembers it and he says he was just stressed or that he forgot as an excuse to everything. I got scared of how I behaved when he kept lying, I hit myself to get him to stop lying but he still would continue to lie making me feel like that didnt happen when it really did and I have a clear memory of it. I screamed and hurt myself because he wouldn’t stop lying. Anyway I stopped talking to him after that. Then he comes back and says you stop talking to me that’s why I get into a relationship with you. He lived off of me (which he says he asked me and I said ok once and he never bothered to ask about it even when I didn’t have salary and when I brought it up and asked him to spend he did spend but he also said he’d leave rather than being a burden). I did point out things that he didn’t do. Like cleaning up after himself and I asked him to stop smoking up around me. He says he didn’t feel free. When I say something to him, he says I’m mean and he called his ex when I was away and told her I was forcing him to stay. In reality he wanted to stay and he keeps saying he loves living with me etc etc. he also lied about loving me because he himself tells that he wanted the relationship out of guilt trip and when I confront him about that he says he did love me. I’m confused. I have been telling him the truth of how he has been and how incompetent he was and how immature and childish and incapable he is because he says he’ll be with me again, he says I’m degrading him? I’m just giving him reasons why I shouldn’t be with him because he will continue to treat me like shit again. I hate him. He’s so happily living his life after sucking life out of me. I can’t do anything and I can’t even get out of bed and I have been crying everyday for the last 3 months. I’ve not felt loved and cared for at all while I did eveything for him. He said if it was his ex he would’ve had to tell his parents But not in my case about the abortion. I can’t let him leave without the process being completed. But he keeps abandoning me. He mentally manipulated me or I don’t know if he did also but everything in the relationship was about him on most of the days. He’s definitely very selfish and self absorbed because if I ask him something he’ll need a benefit for him in it. He will plan his outings with his friends/make other plans/keep playing video games while I’ll be rolling in pain in the other room. He also victimised himself too much and said I yelled at him everyday. I only yelled at him when he didn’t do the thing I asked to do a thousand times or he was playing video games while I needed him. (That also after I told him so many times). He calls out names pretty quickly. He also acts like a therapist sometimes and when I called that out he said I am a bully and he has to self therapise when I know that he picked up the talking style from a TV show. He accuses me of that when he knows its true. He himself agrees to it. He watches TV Shows and gets influenced and changes his personality and when I say if he keeps changing idk how to talk he’s like I’m a bully. I was violent two days ago to myself and I yelled loudly because he wouldn’t stop lying over and over again and he would keep insisting it’s not true until I prove it to him. I yelled at him previously for whatever he did but during confrontation he victimised himself so much. He treated me like a live in maid who he gets to occasionally have sex with. I don’t understand if I’m wrong or he is, because I see my reactions were rude but were triggered by him constantly breaking boundaries, but his were driven by ego and it’s almost like he would complain about me to me because I should’ve just let him walk all over me and have no boundaries. He kept saying I’m unclean and later said he said that because I wasn’t letting him clean. While I know I’m clean. He made me question everything about myself. He said he called me lazy and sleeping while I was depressed and said it’s a trigger for him. He said I made him gain weight by getting him food. He blames everything on someone else and never acknowledges his mistake. I feel empty I don’t even know why I’m thinking about him now. He was the one to ask me out. He told his ex that he doesn’t wanna date me while telling me he loves me 30 minutes later. He keeps changing his words and using words like violent bully abusive to make me feel like I’m the problem while he’s done all this.

I’ve been watching from the start and I’ve never noticed that. If it’s true. 

Is it?

Hi there, 

Cutting a story short, ive been told I wont be able to become a MCD and therefore ive decided to look at other jobs, hopefully something that will give me a trade when I get out. Therefore, ive taken a liking to WE, from what ive read its about electronics and systems more than anything.... is this so? 

I also have a few questions after all the threads ive read, any help would be appreciated! 

1. WE vs ME, is WE more electronics and systems based? Most seem to say its the less 'dirtier' job out of the two (ME and WE) 

2. Whats the pay like for a WE? Thats on a fleet ship and as a submariner as id like to know how different they are

3. Which is best to go, WE submariner or WE fleet? I can see being 'fleet' is probably easier as (at a guess) you'd travel more and see more of the world, however is this really true? Dont you see much of the world as a submariner? (Obviously you're underwated, granted, but dont you stop off at multiple locations like fleet or?) 

4. Can you stay in contact with the outside world as a submariner? I read that they only get chance to send one message a week to family, is this really true? 

Any help would be appreciated, thanks again! Any extra advice or knowledge is also helpful!
