This week I adopted a kind of spicy 9mo kitten named Guava! He was abandoned and then lost his eye, so he's quite distrustful of humans. He almost always hisses 2-3 times when walking up to him, but once you let him sniff you, pet him, and hold him, he turns in to a cuddly purring mess. However, if I stand back up he immediately starts hissing and cowering again. I'm totally not upset/worried about this as I knew this is how he was before adopting him from the rescue, and we are completely in love with him. I was wondering if anyone had any advice to help him not be so anxious when humans are walking around, or if it's just something that will take a lot of time and practice. We also have another 7 y/o cat named Frankie and they have been chatting back and forth through the door for the last two days (We figured we'd let Guava adjust to the bedroom before letting him venture out). Thanks!

Hey everyone! I'm looking to rehome my cat due to some extenuating circumstances. She's fully vaccinated and spayed with all of the documentation. I'm not charging any fees, and I'll include all of the accessories I've acquired for her over the years!
