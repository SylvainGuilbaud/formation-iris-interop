2020-10-29 16:12:22 : Guilt, shame and trauma : lueyforthethrone : https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/jkcyx2/guilt_shame_and_trauma/

My partner died by suicide in July. He was my first and only love of almost 9 years. He was 28 and I‚Äôm 29. The last interactions we had that day, were an argument. The last texts I sent him, the last words I spoke, and I even wrote an unkind hand written note that day because we were arguing the whole day. All of it was mean and I was drunk and I can‚Äôt remember exactly what I said. He ended his life while I was home playing with the dog in the kitchen of our apartment. I was playing with her to cheer up, sober up and get ready to forgive and talk to him....but I was too late and I found him in our bedroom. He didn‚Äôt die immediately, but he officially passed away a week later in the hospital. I am so destroyed. Not only was it a suicide, but our last interactions of our loving relationship were unkind. I see lots of posts of people looking back at their last texts saying they love each other. Ours were unkind and I have to live with it. He‚Äôs gone, my partner of 9 years, my soulmate. I had to move out of our apartment because I couldn‚Äôt stay in the place he ended his life. Now I‚Äôm back home in my childhood room with family that doesn‚Äôt get it.

My siblings don‚Äôt ask how I am, even though I only stay in my room and sleep most of the day, my cousins don‚Äôt and my friends might check in once a week if I‚Äôm lucky. This happened in July, why the fuck do people think I‚Äôm ok now, if ever? I witnessed his suicide and I had to walk away from the life we built for 9 years. Nobody gets it and I kind of hate everyone. Nobody I know knows partner loss, much less a suicide, much less one you witnessed. No one understands losing the one and only home you had with your love because they did the deed there. And no one understands the crippling loneliness I now feel. His friends don‚Äôt text me anymore, but some post of social media about him. I just don‚Äôt understand how people don‚Äôt ask how I am. I lost my half, and there is a reason they‚Äôre called your half. Our lives were meshed together and we lived parallel to each other. Everyday I talked to him, and almost everyday I saw him. The last 3 years I saw his face everyday. The only person who cared this deeply about me is gone because he couldn‚Äôt take this world anymore, and u don‚Äôt remember what I said but it didn‚Äôt help. And now it feels like I fucking deserve this loneliness, despair and depression. What a miserable existence

Pozdrav svima! 

Evo zadnjih nekoliko mjeseci konstantno ucim Javascriptu uz faks. Zanima me fullstack dev, ali vise backend. 

Radio sam Odin Project, dosao sam do djela sa Reactom, pa sam odlucio ipak stati malo tu i vise poraditi na vanilla JS. Evo me trenutno na pola knjige Eloquent Javascript. Pokusavam stvarno shvatiti sto se zapravo dogaƒëa kad nesto pisem. 

Nakon svega toga sto sam naucio, nisam i dalje siguran koliko zapravo znam. Pa evo, moje pitanje je - imali neki JS developer koji bi htio sa mnom proci kroz neke stvari, da zapravo vidi kako i gdje stojim, pa da me moze uputiti u daljnje ucenje :)

2023-04-19 14:23:08 : King‚Äôs Low Period - When and What : Cable_Intrepid : https://www.reddit.com/r/stephenking/comments/12ruxte/kings_low_period_when_and_what/

A common post in this subreddit is ‚ÄúShould I read this?‚Äù (usually with a photo of some dog-eared paperback) and I‚Äôm starting to wonder if that‚Äôs a polite way to ask around the wildly held belief that King went through a kind of low period. Or a number of low periods. 

Be it drugs or recovery from injury or something else, what (IYHO) are the King books that suffered in quality because of some distraction or addiction? Is there a period of time where King wasn‚Äôt on top of his game?
