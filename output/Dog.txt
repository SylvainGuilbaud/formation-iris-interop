2023-04-19 16:09:38 : Tag 7953 various clothing items collect from behind the light blue house near the burn pit. Did Barb have her own burn pit behind her house? Apparently she did, and it was in use as late as September 2005 during Bobby's graduation party. : KenKratzKilledHer : https://www.reddit.com/r/MakingaMurderer/comments/12s0jci/tag_7953_various_clothing_items_collect_from/




### Intro: 



Just as a brief explanation how this post came about - In one of the recent Kuss road posts I mentioned on 11/11 Riemer reports collecting "burnt material" southeast of Steven's red garage (confusing directional not leading to Radandt / RJ property berm). After taking a closer look at Reimer's 11/11 report I came away with this post about Barb's burn pit, which I didn't even know about. Sometimes you can learn something new via review of old documents.






&amp;nbsp;


## The Light Blue House ... and Burn Pit?


&amp;nbsp;




CASO 227 is Riemer's 11/11 report when he watched the DCI destroy the alleged scene of Teresa's mutilation via needlessly destructive means of recovery - "The excavation was accomplished by the use of two skid-steer loaders." All before a coroner was able to examine the scene. Riemer lists items *"recovered during the excavation."* Most of the tags listed are obviously describing the area behind Steven's garage such as Property Tag 7949 - frame from a car seat south of the fire pit - clearly in reference to Steven's fire pit, correct?


&amp;nbsp;



+ In fact tags 7946-7952 were all collected from around "the fire pit" between 0844 hours and 0902 hours (about 15 minutes). Steven's burn pit is only ever described as "the fire pit" by Riemer during this time. 

&amp;nbsp;


+ After Tag 7952 (at 0902 hours) there is a 5.5 hour break before the next Tag 7953 is collected (at 1430). ***Tag 7953 is various clothing items from behind the light blue house "near the burn pit."*** 



&amp;nbsp;


Was this "near the burn pit" describing Barb's light blue house being near Steven's fire pit? That's what I thought at first. But after further research I believe this "near the burn pit" may have been describing the location of 7953 (clothing) in relation to a separate burn pit behind the light blue house.



&amp;nbsp;


## Steven's "Fire Pit" vs. Barb's "Burn Pit"

&amp;nbsp;





+ To summarize so far, Riemer collected tags 7946-7952 from around Steven's ***"fire pit"*** within 17 minutes and before 9:02 AM but then something happened that took him away or distracted him for over 5 hours. The next evidence he collected was Tag 7953 which he describes as various clothing items from behind Barb's house ***"near the burn pit."*** 





+ 1.5 hours later (1557 hrs) Riemer is back collecting bone fragments from behind Steven's garage and the remaining evidence tags (7955-7959) were collected within 15 minutes. Riemer only spent about half hour near Steven's burn pit collecting evidence on 11/11 with a large break in between where clothing was collected from behind Barb's house ... possibly near a burn pit. Can we confirm a burn pit was behind Barb's house. Yes, we can. 






&amp;nbsp;



## Bobby's Graduation Fire and Barb's Burn Pit


&amp;nbsp;



Peter and Lori confirm being at the ASY for Bobby's graduation party in September 2005 (Peter is Bobby's biological father). Brendan and Chuck confirm Barb has a burn pit and it was use during Bobby's graduation party. Chuck even says it was his understanding when the family had a bonfire it was *"usually behind his sister Barb's house"*: 


&amp;nbsp;




CASO 207

+ *"PETER said they had recently been there, around September, for a graduation party and did not observe anything out of the ordinary."* Odd to have a graduation party in September, but Peter's statement is confirmed by the Lori Report.


&amp;nbsp;

CASO 410

+ ***"LORI stated the last time she had been at the AVERY compound would have been around Labor Day weekend for Bobby's graduation.*** *She stated the only reason they went to the graduation is because her current husband is Bobby's father."*

&amp;nbsp;


DCI 035

+ ***"[Brendan] Dassey was asked when was the last time his family had a fire in the fire ring behind his mother Barb Janda's residence*** *at Avery's Auto Salvage property in Manitowoc County. Dassey said it was probably at his brother, Bobby's graduation party."* 


&amp;nbsp;


DCI 034

+ ***"Chuck said when the family has a bonfire, it is usually behind his sister Barb's house,*** *which is next to Steven's house. Chuck was asked when was the last time they had a bonfire behind Barb's house, and he thought it was* ***during a graduation party for his nephew, Bobby,*** *who is Barb's son."*






&amp;nbsp;


## Clothing was found near Barb's burn pit (or fire ring) and Brendan was later identified as Steven's accomplice and questioned about what they did with Teresa's clothes 






&amp;nbsp;



#### A Primary Burn Site? Likely not

 + I even tweaked the title of OP so users didn't think I believed Barb's burn pit would be a primary burn site (certainly no more than I believe Steven's would be). I don't recall cadaver dog alerts on Barb's burn pit (only the barrels) and no one recalls a large fire there (at least not after September/09). However, we can still use this information to question if the state suffered from investigative bias. 


&amp;nbsp;


+ We might as well accept no body was burnt in Barb's burn pit, but it's still possible Bobby (defense theory) or Brendan (state theory) burnt some of Teresa's clothing in that burn pit. So when Riemer notes various clothing items were collected from *"behind the light blue house"* that is in fact *"near the burn pit"* as described by Brendan and Chuck. Chuck even says they burnt tires there, including a large tractor wheel (how big was this burn pit?). 


&amp;nbsp;



#### Should the pit have been investigated? YES

+ Did the state bother conducting any forensic examination of Barb's burn pit or that clothing? And they did ask Brendan in 2005 about "bonfires" in his mom's "fire ring" (see above) but I certainly don't recall this separate burn area or fire ring ever coming up during Brendan's 2006 interviews. 


&amp;nbsp;



+ 11/6 video walk through Barb and Steven's trailer - Officer walks up in between light blue house and garage without going behind the house, where Barb's burn pit is. They then go around the front to the east side of the house, again keeping the burn pit out of view. After entering and exiting Barb's trailer they walk towards the Van and do a 360 (behind Barb's house still blocked) and then move towards Steven's garage and trailer without ever showing the burn pit behind Barb's house. Finally after leaving Steven's garage they do another 360 but the angle so slight, the distance so great and quality so low you can barely make out Barb's house let alone a burn pit behind it. Are there any photos of this "burn pit" or "fire ring" behind Barb's house? 


&amp;nbsp;


+ For now I'll just conclude Barb's burn pit should have gotten some attention from the state. Even without a cadaver dog alert in that area the state's theory required them to investigate all burn sites on or around the ASY. The state considered cremation of a body or burning clothes (rivet) a possible means of evidentiary destruction. NO I don't think Teresa was burned there; but YES Barb's burn pit should have been investigated as a possible site of evidentiary destruction - including various clothing near the pit that Brendan, Bobby and even Steven arguably had access to.

Nothing hurts worse than knowing the only marriage you had wasn’t real. It was real from my end but apparently I was good for a 10 year fuck and nothing else. Ate constant shit from this woman. Verbal abuse and physical abuse. Sex was great, she was funny, not loyal but hindsight and all that. I don’t believe in marriage so I did it for her, the greatest gift I could give. My greatest gift swirled around inside the bowl like a long Turd. Now all I hear is he’s getting me to do this, he said I should try this yada fucking yada. The literal same shit I got beat up over. You’re not their dad don’t tell me how to parent. He said I should give them more freedom. Fuck you you’re wrong and a piece of shit, he said I need to control my anger. I waisted the best years of my life on someone who never actually cared. Heart broken? No I’m fucking shattered. Enjoy the relationship you so casually “found”. The shoulder to cry on when we were “fixing” things. Don’t mind me, the beaten fucking dog in the corner locking his numerous wounds. I’m glad you are finally happy. I’m glad I can’t find another relationship because I can’t talk to woman or all hell will break lose. I’m glad I’m so replaceable after everything. Cheers you fucking demon. At least I have the kids, who can smell your deviant ass a mile away.

I’m applying for a house to rent with a 40 lb weight limit. Documentation of the actual weight is not required, but the dog needs to look close to the weight limit. Does my dog look close to 40 lbs?

2023-04-19 16:14:10 : Training a senior dog to use pee pad? : Mawissacee : https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/12s0txp/training_a_senior_dog_to_use_pee_pad/

My dog is 13 and has had some health issues. It’s difficult for her to go out and potty and when she can’t, she does in the house.

She used to be puppy pad trained but now looks at me like I’m a crazy person. I’ve given her treats when she sniffs the potty pad or stands in it. I’ve waited until first thing in the morning when she has to pee and guide her to the pad, and say “go potty!” but she refuses.

I’ve placed the pad indoors where she’s usually had accidents but she gets confused. 

I’ve placed the potty pad on the grass where she normally goes, but is freaked out because the pads don’t quite sit in top of turf grass and the rustling sound turns her off.

Does anyone have any advice or experience in re-training their senior dog to use the potty pad indoors again? It’s been difficult finding anything like that in the internet.

2023-04-19 16:19:18 : How to make myself believe - manifest - that I already have loving, intimate physical touch? (Aside from self pleasure) Would be great to have more explorations on this topic. : Honobonohoshi : https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofattraction/comments/12s16au/how_to_make_myself_believe_manifest_that_i/

I understand that in order to manifest, first you fake it until it's real. I kind of understand how that works on my mindset and perception of myself. However, I'm a bit lost on examples on how to make myself (conscious and unconscious) believe that I already have loving, intimate physical touch?

Going to massages could be a way, but for me it's a bit more about feeling love through touch of skin, warmth and breath of another being. Health massages don't really convince my subconsciousness enough on this topic. For me this has been so far the hardest part to believe that I'm whole and fully happy with or without a partner. I'm from and currently living in a culture which hugs don't occur often. And I'm not too keen on the idea of pleasure partners (not sure what's the best way to say this here).

It would be great for me to hear about your suggestions for this. Thank you all!

(Now that I think of it, getting in touch with friendly dogs might also be an option.)

2023-04-19 16:20:34 : Stray Dogs Rescue/Care : bongbong- : https://www.reddit.com/r/karachi/comments/12s19mo/stray_dogs_rescuecare/

I wanted to call an animal shelter to take in an injured stray dog but most of them are only pet clinics or rescue animals that are cats or birds and the rest of them didn't have good reviews.

Is there no good animal shelter that rescues stray dogs ( and actually takes care of them) when you call and provide them the location ?

2023-04-19 16:20:43 : Why I, a black bear (21 F) believe I could beat a human in a fight. : THEHONEYBADGERRR1211 : https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/12s19yx/why_i_a_black_bear_21_f_believe_i_could_beat_a/

First, I am going to set some ground rules.

\- Neither I, nor the human have access to advanced weaponry (short pointy sticks, boom sticks, that bad-smelling spray thing, Bearco. patented Human Spray, etc.)

\- Specifically a 220lbs, 5'11, well built male human, quite used to tossing around objects weighing much more than 180 lbs, who has also played contact sports his entire life.

\- I do not need to kill the human, just take out all of their organs and cause massive bleeding.

\- Both the human and I get to listen to human growl music before the fight.

The stats: (All my stats I found from [pornhub.com](https://pornhub.com) \- I trust they are accurate but I apologize if they are not.)

\- As mentioned, specifically a 220lbs, 5'11, well built male human, quite used to tossing around objects weighing much more than 180 lbs, who has also played contact sports his entire life.

\- I weigh 180 lbs and am 6ft tall

\- I have eaten 5 large dogs and "have those dawgs in me" as humans may say.

The fight:

In a boxing match, I win as I am much stronger. They would be unable to run away as I am much faster. Neither of these are viable options. Thus I only see two options in which they emerge the victor.

The first way would be for them to choke me out. They would need to avoid my mouth and paws , but if they were able to get behind me due to my poor eyesight (I know we have good eyesight but I had another guy try to fight me last year and he tried poking my eyes out while we fought and it hasn't really been the same since, absolutely mauled that guy tho lol). I would have to have a very thin neck and not think of retaliating against this at all, even though I can kill him with a single swipe.

The second way would be for them to blind me. In this scenario they would need to be fully prepared to sacrifice an arm, a leg, their testicles, two eyes, a nose, half an ear, their scalp, a kidney, and their lungs, and while I am attacking them, they would use sticks or fingers to try to blind me. I am aware that I have small eyes, however, if they really concentrated while I was having a nice liver breakfast, I believe they might be able to hit their target.

TL/DR: I could beat a human in a fight, but if they could blind me or choke me out, I'm absolutely dead.

EDIT: I have been informed that humans cannot in fact live without their lungs.

2023-04-19 16:20:52 : SSRIs and timing : 4201minus1 : https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/12s1abe/ssris_and_timing/

Hi there! I’m a vet tech assistant (been one for a little over 2 years) and I’ve seen my fair share of dogs on SSRIs. My own dog had to be put on fluoxetine a little over a month ago for his crippling anxiety of the outside world. 

My question is do any of you have dogs on Fluoxetine? If so, how long did it take to see any changes if any. I know it takes a while to show results but I just wanted to ask.
